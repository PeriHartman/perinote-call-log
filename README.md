# perinote-call-log

The Perinote Calls companion app provides access to your recent calls and provides that information to Perinote Organizer. By itself it is not particularly useful, however it is absolutely required for Perinote Organizer to display call log data. For information or installing Perinote Organizer, please see our website:
    http://perinote.com

In the past, Perinote Organizer directly accessed the call log and provided call log data to the user. However, Google recently (Q1 2019) changed how apps can use certain sensitve permissions. With good reason, Google wishes to protect user privacy from malicious apps. However, in doing so, they have prevented most apps from accessing call log data. Thus, to allow access to call log data, we moved that part into this separate companion app and provide the app to you outside of the Play Store.

The companion app is completely safe. We have provided the source code in this repository and welcome you to inspect it. However, if you prefer, you can certainly use Perinote Organizer without installing Perinote Calls. You just won't be able use use call log data.

Neither Perinote Calls nor Perinote Organizer sends any of your call information to third parties nor to Perinote LLC or its affiliates. This is explained in detail in our incredibly private privacy policy.
